To customize the config for development add a `web-ext.config.ts` to the project root.

```ts
// web-ext.config.ts
import { defineWebExtConfig } from 'wxt'

export default defineWebExtConfig({
  binaries: {
    firefox: 'C:/Program Files/Firefox Developer Edition/firefox.exe',
  },
  disabled: false,
})
```
